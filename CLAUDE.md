## Voice — CRITICAL
Jess has precise, principled language. Read `noodle/brand-voice/jess-voice-guide.txt` before writing ANY copy.

**Quick rules:**
- "disabled" (not "special needs") — "Disability is not a bad word"
- "autistic" (identity-first, not "has autism" or "ASD")
- "nonspeaking" (not "nonverbal")
- "support needs" (not "functioning level")
- "neurodivergent" / "neurodivergence" (not "disorder")
- We fix the training GAP, not the students
- Peer voice, not expert-above — "we are teachers, not professors"
- Practical and Monday-ready, not theoretical
- Joy in the work, not duty or charity

**Key mantras:** "Watch the Children" · "Humans, Not Curriculum" · "Labels Are for Jars" · "Know Your Audience" · "Remove Barriers"
