---

Hi Meesh,

Attached are the completed answers for both questionnaires (Abuse & Molestation and Comprehensive), along with supporting documents for Medley Music Access & Inclusion.

**A few things to know upfront:**

- **Entity structure:** Green Wall Group LLC has existed for ~15 years (affordable housing, financial services — completely unrelated to this application). "Medley Music Access & Inclusion" is a new DBA under that LLC for Jess's inclusive music education work. The insurance we're seeking covers **only Medley's activities** — the LLC's other business lines are separate and not part of this application.
- Medley is in early startup. Jess currently runs the Adaptive Music Program at the Springfield Community Music School (communitymusicschool.com), where she's directed adaptive music instruction in public school classrooms for ~5 years, serving 600+ students with a team of 9 teaching artists. She will transition to Medley full-time at the end of June. Jen Kass and Jon Burgos both work with her there now. We have one school contract for adaptive music instruction starting February 24 (part-time, alongside her current role). PD offerings will begin ramping up in spring, with full operations starting summer 2026.
- We need **all coverage** (general liability, BOP, and A&M) in place before that first school date (Feb 24), which is the immediate driver here.
- We are pre-revenue on the Medley side — all financial figures are first-year projections for Medley only.
- The supporting policy documents (staff handbook, acknowledgment form, media release) **have been drafted for implementation and will be formally adopted and executed before February 24.** They were developed based on our understanding of what's required for organizations working with minors and vulnerable individuals in Massachusetts. If the insurer has specific requirements or recommended changes, we're happy to adjust — we want to end up with policies that work for the insurer and for our business model and student population.
- **Background checks:** Our policy requires CORI, SORI, and FBI fingerprint checks for all staff with student contact, plus CORI/SORI for all owners. Jess (owner/director) and our two instructors (Jen and Jon) all hold valid, current CORI and FBI fingerprint clearances through their existing employer (Springfield Community Music School) where they do identical work — adaptive music instruction in public school classrooms. Our third employee is a graphic artist with no student contact. Medley's own independent CORI/SORI checks have been initiated and our policy requires completion within 30 days of start date. Our handbook allows staff with verified current clearances from a Massachusetts public school employer to begin work while Medley's own checks are processed. Can you confirm this approach works for the insurer, and advise how best to represent it on the forms?

**What we do:** Medley provides (1) adaptive music instruction for students with disabilities, primarily in public school classrooms but occasionally at other community facilities such as libraries, and (2) professional development workshops for music educators, delivered at host sites and online. We are also developing an educational songbook. Medley does not own or lease any facilities — all in-person services take place at host locations.

**What's attached:**
1. Abuse & Molestation Questionnaire — completed answers
2. Comprehensive Questionnaire — completed answers
3. Staff Policy Handbook (includes abuse prevention, incident reporting, background check policies)
4. Policy Acknowledgment Form
5. Photo & Media Release Form

Philip
