## Description of Operations (for broker context)

Medley Music Access & Inclusion provides two primary services:

1. **Adaptive music instruction for students with disabilities** — Medley instructors teach music in public school classrooms alongside school support staff (paraprofessionals, aides, classroom teachers) who are present throughout every session. Medley may also occasionally provide instruction at other community facilities such as libraries. Medley does not transport students, does not have unsupervised access to minors, and operates within the host site's existing supervision structure. *First engagement begins Feb 24, 2026 — one school, part-time. Full operations begin summer 2026.*

2. **Professional development for music teachers** — Workshops and training sessions teaching inclusive and adaptive music education practices. Delivered in-person at host sites that engage Medley (public schools, college campuses, conference venues) and online. Participants are adult professionals (music teachers, administrators). Medley does not rent or lease any facilities — host organizations provide the space.

3. **Educational publishing** — Medley is developing a songbook of original songs and activities for inclusive music education. This will be published and sold as an educational resource.

Medley does not own or lease any facility. All in-person services are delivered at third-party host sites or via online platforms.
