## About This Handbook

This handbook contains the policies and procedures that apply to all employees, contractors, and volunteers of Medley Music Access & Inclusion. Read it in full and sign the Policy Acknowledgment Form before beginning any work with Medley.

Medley provides professional development for music educators and adaptive music instruction for students, including minors and individuals with disabilities. These policies exist to protect the people we serve and to maintain the professional standards our work requires.

# Part 1: Abuse Prevention

## 1.1 Zero-Tolerance Statement

Medley maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward any form of abuse, neglect, molestation, or exploitation of any client, student, or program participant. Any staff member who engages in, conceals, or fails to report such conduct will be subject to immediate termination and referral to law enforcement.

## 1.2 Definitions

**Abuse** includes but is not limited to:

- **Physical abuse:** Any non-accidental physical injury or act that creates a substantial risk of physical injury
- **Sexual abuse:** Any sexual contact or interaction with a minor or vulnerable individual, including but not limited to inappropriate touching, exposure, exploitation, or solicitation
- **Emotional abuse:** A pattern of behavior that impairs a person's emotional development or sense of self-worth, including constant criticism, threats, intimidation, or rejection
- **Neglect:** Failure to provide adequate supervision, safety, or care when responsible for a minor or vulnerable individual

## 1.3 Appropriate Behaviors

- Maintaining professional boundaries at all times
- Using positive, respectful language with all students and participants
- Providing instruction in observable, accessible settings
- Communicating with families through official channels
- Redirecting behavior using positive, non-physical techniques
- Using professional judgment around physical contact to support student participation (see Section 2.3 for full guidelines)

## 1.4 Prohibited Behaviors

- Being alone with a minor in a closed, unobservable space
- Any form of physical discipline or punishment
- Any sexual, romantic, or intimate contact or communication with a minor or vulnerable individual
- Sharing personal contact information (personal phone, social media) with minor students
- Transporting a minor alone without written parental/guardian consent
- Giving personal gifts to individual students
- Photographing or recording students without written consent from parent/guardian
- Using alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances in the presence of students
- Making demeaning, degrading, or sexually suggestive comments
- Grooming behaviors, including: building secretive relationships with students ("this is our special thing"), excessive personal attention or favoritism, sharing personal problems with students, testing boundaries incrementally, or any attempt to isolate a student from peers or other adults

## 1.5 Supervision Requirements

- When providing direct instruction to minors, at least one other adult (Medley staff or host-site staff) must be present or the instruction must take place in an observable setting.
- **"Observable setting"** means a space where the instructor and students are visible and accessible to other adults who can reasonably monitor the session or enter the space if needed — for example, an open door to an occupied hallway, a windowed room facing a staffed area, or a shared classroom with other adults present.
- No employee or volunteer may be alone in a closed, unobservable space with a minor.
- When Medley operates within a host school or facility, Medley staff will comply with the host site's supervision policies in addition to this policy. Where the host site's policies are stricter than Medley's, the stricter policy applies.
- If a suitable observable space is not available at a host site, the staff member must request a different location or arrange for another adult to be present before beginning a session.

## 1.6 Transportation

Staff may not transport students in personal vehicles under any circumstances. All Medley services occur at host school facilities. Students remain under school custody before and after Medley instruction.

## 1.7 Investigation and Law Enforcement Cooperation

Medley will promptly investigate all reports of suspected abuse. If at any point during an investigation there is reason to believe abuse has occurred, Medley will:

1. Immediately report to the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) via 51A filing
2. Cooperate fully with law enforcement and DCF investigations
3. Not interfere with, obstruct, or attempt to influence any external investigation

---

# Part 2: Code of Conduct

## 2.1 Professional Boundaries

All staff will:

- Treat every student, participant, and colleague with dignity and respect
- Maintain clear professional boundaries in all interactions
- Use respectful language when discussing disability, following identity-first conventions (e.g., "disabled students," "autistic students," "nonspeaking students") unless an individual or family expresses a different preference
- Recognize that our role is to serve learners, not to fix them
- Defer to families and caregivers on matters of personal care, medical needs, and behavioral support outside the scope of music instruction

## 2.2 Communication

- All communication with families of minor students must go through official Medley channels (organizational email, official phone number)
- Staff may not exchange personal phone numbers, social media handles, or private messaging information with minor students
- Staff may not communicate with minor students through any private or personal channel
- Communication with adult PD participants may use standard professional channels

## 2.3 Physical Contact and Professional Support

Medley provides adaptive music instruction to students with physical, sensory, and developmental disabilities. In this context, instructional and therapeutic physical contact is a necessary and professionally recognized component of effective instruction.

All physical contact is provided by credentialed professionals — including a board-certified music therapist (MT-BC) and music educators with specialized training in autism and inclusive practice — and is goal-directed, task-specific, and guided by established standards of professional practice.

### Permitted Contact

Physical contact is limited to actions that directly support a student's participation, learning, or safety. Permitted forms of contact include:

- **Instrumental assistance:** Hand-over-hand or hand-under-hand guidance to facilitate instrument playing (e.g., mallet grip, keyboard fingering, strumming)
- **Postural and positioning support:** Physical assistance to help a student sit, hold an instrument, or maintain a stable position for safe participation
- **Motor prompting:** Brief, targeted physical prompts to guide a student's movement during a structured music activity
- **Safety stabilization:** Momentary support to prevent injury during active movement or transitions

All staff-initiated contact is directly related to an instructional objective, limited to the duration necessary for the task, and consistent with the practitioner's training and scope of practice.

### Student-Initiated Contact

Students with developmental, sensory, and physical disabilities frequently initiate physical contact with trusted adults. This is a well-documented characteristic of this population and an expected part of the therapeutic and educational relationship. Students may seek physical closeness, lean against an instructor, reach for or grasp an instructor's hands or body, climb into an instructor's lap, or sit in close physical proximity during instruction.

When a student initiates contact, staff respond with professional clinical judgment:

- Staff do not abruptly reject or forcibly remove a student who seeks physical closeness, as this can cause distress and harm the student's sense of safety and trust. Instead, staff use their clinical and educational training to determine the appropriate response — which may include allowing the contact briefly, gently redirecting the student to a more appropriate position, or using the moment as an instructional opportunity.
- When student-initiated contact goes beyond what is typical for the instructional task (e.g., a student climbing into an instructor's lap or seeking prolonged physical closeness), staff redirect when clinically appropriate and document the behavior in session notes.
- Staff may always disengage from any contact at their own discretion, without fear of reprisal. Staff safety and comfort are also protected.
- Expected student-initiated behaviors, including physical contact patterns, are discussed with parents/guardians and the school team **before the first session** as part of intake planning, and revisited as part of ongoing collaboration about the student's needs.
- All sessions take place in observable environments with other adults present (see Section 1.5). In practice, Medley instructors work within active classrooms alongside school support staff — paraprofessionals, aides, and classroom teachers — who are present throughout the session.

### Safeguards

- Staff narrate their actions during physical contact ("I'm going to help guide your hand to the drum") and monitor for the student's verbal and non-verbal responses throughout
- Staff immediately cease contact upon any sign of discomfort, distress, or refusal
- Physical support strategies are discussed with parents/guardians and the student's school team before the first session and aligned with the student's existing educational or therapeutic plans (IEP, 504, etc.)
- All instruction involving physical contact takes place in observable environments (open doors, windowed rooms, or other adults present)

### Scope Limitations

Medley staff provide music instruction only. Staff do not perform:

- Personal care or activities of daily living (restroom assistance, feeding, hygiene, clothing adjustment)
- Medical or nursing interventions
- Physical interventions beyond the scope of music instruction

These are the responsibility of school personnel or the student's designated support team.

### Prohibited

- Physical discipline or punitive contact of any kind
- Physical restraint (staff defer to designated school or crisis intervention personnel)
- Any sexual, romantic, or exploitative contact
- Contact unrelated to an instructional or safety purpose
- Continuation of contact when a student communicates refusal or distress through any means

## 2.4 Digital and Social Media

- Staff may not follow, friend, or connect with minor students on personal social media accounts
- Staff may not privately message minor students on any platform
- Photographs or video of students may only be taken with prior written consent from the parent/guardian and must be used only for authorized Medley purposes
- Staff may not post images of students to personal social media accounts

## 2.5 Gifts and Favoritism

- Staff may not give personal gifts to individual students
- Organizational items (e.g., certificates, group treats for a class) are permitted
- Staff must avoid any appearance of favoritism toward individual students

## 2.6 Substance Use

- Use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or any controlled substance is prohibited during any Medley activity or while supervising students
- Staff may not be under the influence of any intoxicating substance during Medley activities

## 2.7 Consequences

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed based on severity and may include:

- Verbal or written warning
- Suspension from Medley activities pending investigation
- Immediate termination
- Referral to law enforcement

Any conduct involving suspected abuse of a minor will result in immediate suspension pending investigation and mandatory reporting to DCF.

## 2.8 Emergency Procedures

Medley operates within host schools and facilities that maintain their own emergency protocols. All staff must:

- Complete any host-site emergency orientation or training required of contractors
- Follow host-site protocols for medical emergencies, student elopement, building evacuation, and lockdown
- Not administer medication or provide medical interventions — defer to school personnel or the student's designated support team
- Notify the Director of any emergency or near-miss as soon as the situation is stabilized, and document it per the Incident Reporting Procedure (Part 5)

## 2.9 Host School Compliance

When working at host schools or facilities, Medley staff must:

- Comply with all host site safety, security, and conduct policies
- Follow the host school's visitor and contractor procedures (sign-in, badge requirements, etc.)
- Coordinate with host site staff on supervision and emergency procedures
- Report any incidents to both the host site administration and the Medley Director

# Part 4: Background Check Policy

## 4.1 Required Checks

Prior to beginning any work that involves contact with minors or vulnerable individuals, the following checks must be completed:

| Check | Required |
|-------|----------|
| CORI (Criminal Offender Record Information) — Massachusetts | Yes |
| SORI (Sex Offender Registry Information) — Massachusetts | Yes |
| National criminal background check (name-based) | Yes |
| National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW) search | Yes |
| Fingerprint-based national criminal history check (FBI/CHSB) | Yes, for all staff with direct student or participant contact |
| Verification of identity (government-issued photo ID) | Yes |
| Professional license/certification verification (where applicable) | Yes |

If an individual has resided outside Massachusetts in the past 5 years, an out-of-state criminal records check is also required.

Staff who hold a current, valid fingerprint-based clearance through a Massachusetts public school district or licensed educational employer may begin work upon written verification of that clearance from the issuing employer, provided Medley's own CORI and SORI checks have been initiated. All Medley-required checks must be completed within 30 days of the staff member's start date. Documentation of outside clearances does not replace Medley's independent screening — it permits work to begin while Medley's own checks are processed. The Green Wall Group LLC is registered as a CORI requester with the Massachusetts Criminal History Systems Board (CHSB).

## 4.2 Timing

- All required checks must be completed and reviewed **before** the individual has any contact with minors or vulnerable individuals
- No individual may begin working with students until background check results have been received and reviewed by the Director
- The sole exception is the transition provision in Section 4.1: staff with verified current clearances from a Massachusetts public school or licensed educational employer may begin work while Medley's independent checks are completed, provided those checks have been initiated and will be completed within 30 days

## 4.3 Renewal

- Background checks (CORI and SORI at minimum) will be renewed **every 3 years** for all active employees, contractors, and regular volunteers
- If Medley becomes aware of a new criminal charge or conviction for any active staff member, an updated check will be conducted immediately

## 4.4 Review and Disqualification

The following result in automatic disqualification:

- Any conviction for a crime against a child or vulnerable person
- Any conviction for a sexual offense
- Registration on any sex offender registry
- Any pending charges for the above

Other criminal history will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature and gravity of the offense, time elapsed, and the nature of the position.

## 4.5 Applicant Rights

- All applicants will be informed in writing that a background check is required
- Applicants will provide written consent for all checks
- If an adverse decision is made based on results, the applicant will be notified in writing and given an opportunity to dispute the accuracy, consistent with Massachusetts CORI law

## 4.6 Confidentiality

- Background check results are confidential, stored securely and separately from general personnel files
- Access is limited to the Director
- Results are retained for the duration of association plus 7 years after separation

## 4.7 Owner Status

Philip Silva (Owner/Business Manager) and Jessica Corwin (Owner/Director) are excluded from workers' compensation and payroll as LLC owners. Both are subject to background screening and all policies in this handbook.

- **Jessica Corwin** provides direct adaptive music instruction to minors and is fully covered under all liability and abuse & molestation insurance. She is subject to all screening and conduct policies and maintains current CORI/fingerprint clearance through her position as a Massachusetts public school teacher, in addition to Medley's own checks.
- **Philip Silva** serves as Business Manager with no direct student contact. He is subject to CORI and SORI screening, the Code of Conduct, and all reporting obligations in this handbook.

# Part 5: Incident Reporting Procedure

## 5.1 Mandated Reporter Designation

Massachusetts law designates teachers, counselors, and certain other professionals as **mandated reporters** who are legally required to report suspected child abuse or neglect (M.G.L. c. 119, Section 51A). Staff who hold these professional roles are mandated reporters under state law. As a matter of organizational policy, Medley requires **all** staff — regardless of statutory status — to follow the same reporting procedures described in this section. Failure by any staff member to report as required by this policy is grounds for immediate termination.

## 5.2 What Must Be Reported

### Suspected Abuse or Neglect of a Minor (51A)

Any staff member who has **reasonable cause to believe** that a child under 18 is suffering from abuse or neglect must report. This includes:

- Physical injury not consistent with an accident
- Sexual abuse or exploitation
- Emotional abuse or chronic neglect
- Disclosure by a child that they are being abused or neglected
- Observations of unexplained injuries, fear of a caregiver, or other warning signs

**You do not need to be certain.** Reasonable suspicion is sufficient and required.

### Other Reportable Incidents

- Any injury to a student or participant during a Medley activity
- Any allegation of inappropriate conduct by a staff member
- Any safety hazard or near-miss during a Medley activity
- Any violation of this handbook

## 5.3 Reporting Suspected Abuse of a Minor (51A)

**Step 1: Immediately call DCF**

Massachusetts Department of Children and Families Child Abuse Hotline:
**1-800-792-5200** (24 hours, 7 days)

Do not wait. Do not investigate on your own first.

**Step 2: Notify the Director**

Immediately after contacting DCF, notify the Director (Jessica Corwin) by phone or in person. If the allegation involves the Director, notify the Business Manager (Philip Silva) instead.

**Step 3: Written report within 48 hours**

File a written 51A report with DCF including: name, age, and address of the child; name and address of parent/guardian; nature and extent of suspected abuse or neglect; how you became aware; any actions taken; and any other relevant information. The Director will assist with this process.

**Step 4: Cooperate with investigation**

Cooperate fully with DCF and law enforcement. Do not contact the alleged perpetrator or the child's family to discuss the report. Do not discuss the report with other staff except as necessary for the investigation.

## 5.4 Reporting Other Incidents

1. Address any immediate safety concerns
2. Notify the Director verbally as soon as possible, and in writing within 24 hours
3. Document: date, time, location, individuals involved, witnesses, description, actions taken, follow-up needed

## 5.5 Response to Allegations Against Staff

1. The staff member is **immediately suspended** from all student contact pending investigation
2. If a minor is involved, a 51A report is filed with DCF
3. The Director conducts an internal review
4. Actions may include reinstatement, additional training, termination, or referral to law enforcement
5. No student contact is permitted until the investigation is complete

## 5.6 Protections

- **Good faith reporters are protected.** Massachusetts law shields mandated reporters from liability for reports made in good faith, even if later determined to be unfounded
- **Retaliation is prohibited.** Medley will not retaliate against any individual who makes a good-faith report
- **Failure to report is a crime.** Under Massachusetts law, mandated reporters who fail to report suspected abuse may face criminal penalties

## 5.7 Record Retention

All incident reports, 51A filings, and related documentation are retained **permanently** in a secure, confidential file. Access is limited to the Director and, when necessary, legal counsel or law enforcement.

# Part 6: Photo and Media Policy

## 6.1 Consent Requirements

**Adults (18+):** Written consent must be obtained before their likeness or words are used in any Medley materials. Consent must specify the types of use authorized. Individuals may revoke consent at any time in writing.

**Minors (under 18):** Written consent must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. If the minor is old enough to understand (generally age 12+), their assent should also be obtained.

**Individuals under guardianship:** Consent must be obtained from the legal guardian.

## 6.2 Standards

- Medley will use respectful, identity-first language and framing in all media featuring disabled individuals
- Images and descriptions will center the individual's participation and musicianship, never their disability as a subject of inspiration or pity
- No image or recording will be used in a way that is demeaning, exploitative, or misrepresentative
