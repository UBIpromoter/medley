**Q2. Written abuse policies?** → **YES**

- a. Zero-tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviors → **YES**
- b. Define appropriate and inappropriate behaviors → **YES**

*(See attached: Staff Policy Handbook — Abuse Prevention Policy section. Note: handbook is in draft form, ready to be finalized and executed before first school engagement Feb 24.)*

**Q3. Require employees sign they have read abuse policies and retain the record?** → **YES**

**Q4. Enforce the 3-person rule?** → **YES**

When providing direct instruction to minors, at least one other adult (Medley staff or host-site staff) must be present or instruction takes place in an observable setting. Medley operates within public school classrooms where school staff and supervision are already in place.

**Q5. How does your organization monitor client areas?** → **☑ Not applicable**

Medley does not own, lease, or rent any facility. Instruction of minors takes place primarily within host public school classrooms that provide their own monitoring and supervision, and occasionally at other community facilities such as libraries. Professional development sessions take place at host sites that engage Medley (public schools, college campuses, conference venues) or online.

**Q6. Employee and/or volunteer screening controls:**

*Note: Medley has 3 part-time W-2 employees. Two (Jen Kass, Jon Burgos) are instructors/presenters who work directly with students and PD participants. The third (Isaiah Eddington) is a graphic artist producing materials for the songbook and company — he has no contact with students or clients and does not enter school facilities. No volunteers at this time. Owners (Philip Silva, Jessica Corwin) are LLC members excluded from W-2 payroll but fully covered under all liability and A&M insurance. Both owners are subject to background screening. Jessica Corwin is the primary instructor — she provides direct instruction to minors and leads PD workshops, and is subject to all screening and conduct policies. Philip Silva (Business Manager, no student contact) is subject to CORI/SORI screening and all conduct/reporting policies. Full screening and background check requirements apply to all staff with student/client contact (Jess, Jen, and Jon).*

**Q7. Background checks utilized prior to hiring:**

**Context:** Medley's written policy requires all of the following checks prior to student contact. All staff with student contact (Jess, Jen, and Jon) hold valid, current CORI and FBI fingerprint clearances through their existing employers (public schools and clinical settings) where they perform identical work with minors. Medley has initiated its own independent CORI/SORI checks, which per policy must be completed within 30 days of each staff member's start date. Staff with verified current clearances from a Massachusetts public school employer may begin work while Medley's checks are processed.

If yes, collect signed acknowledgements re: rejection/termination on match? → **YES** (per Policy Acknowledgment Form)

**Q10. All screening controls completed prior to:**
- a. Hiring employee or accepting volunteer? → **YES** — all staff have current clearances; Medley's independent checks initiated and due within 30 days of start

*(Incident reports and 51A filings are retained permanently per Incident Reporting Procedure)*

**Q15. Procedure when an employee has an allegation?** → **YES**

Procedure: Employee is immediately suspended from all student contact pending investigation. If a minor is involved, a 51A report is filed with DCF. The Director conducts an internal review.

Do you keep the individual on staff? → **NO** — Suspended pending investigation, may be terminated based on outcome.

What corrective action is taken? Ranges from additional training to termination and referral to law enforcement, depending on findings.

**Q19. Does your organization work with Praesidium?** → **NO**

**Q20. Contractually obligated to carry A&M coverage?** → **Not yet confirmed** — First school engagement begins Feb 24, 2026. We anticipate school contracts will require A&M coverage but have not yet confirmed specific contract language.

If yes, what limits are required by contract? → **Assume $1M per occurrence / $2M aggregate** (standard school requirement — will confirm)

*School contract not yet available to attach — will forward when finalized.*

**Q21. Additional detail to clarify abuse controls:**

Medley operates exclusively within public school classrooms for all instruction of minors. Medley instructors work alongside school support staff — paraprofessionals, aides, and classroom teachers — who are present throughout every session. Medley does not transport students, does not have unsupervised access to minors, and does not operate any residential or overnight programs. All Medley staff hold current CORI and FBI fingerprint clearances through their existing school and clinical employers where they perform identical work with minors. Medley has initiated its own independent CORI/SORI checks, which per policy must be completed within 30 days of each staff member's start date. Director Jessica Corwin is a former public school music teacher and current Program Director of the Adaptive Music Program at Springfield Community Music School, where she has directed adaptive instruction in public school classrooms for ~5 years (600+ students, 9 teaching artists). She is a mandated reporter with extensive experience in inclusive music education.
