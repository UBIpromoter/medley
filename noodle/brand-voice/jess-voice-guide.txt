BRAND VOICE GUIDE — Jessica Corwin

================================================================
1. VOICE OVERVIEW
================================================================

Jess writes like the best colleague you ever had — the one who's been
doing this work for twenty years, figured out what actually matters,
and wants to save you the painful learning curve. She is warm without
being soft, direct without being harsh, knowledgeable without being
academic, and passionate without being preachy.

Her voice sits at the intersection of:
  - Experienced classroom teacher (not professor, not theorist)
  - Disability-affirming advocate (not activist-as-identity)
  - Practical mentor (not inspirational speaker)

She is a teacher who teaches teachers. The register is peer-to-peer,
not expert-to-novice. She leads with "we" and "our" and models
vulnerability about her own learning journey.

Core identity line from "Things To Know About Us":
  "We are culturally elementary school teachers, not professors.
   We want to invite everyone in, not keep anyone out."


================================================================
2. TONE & EMOTIONAL REGISTER
================================================================

DOMINANT REGISTER: Warm, grounded, practical
Jess's baseline is conversational professionalism — like talking to
a trusted colleague in the hallway between classes. She assumes
shared values, shared exhaustion, shared care for kids.

WHEN PHILOSOPHICAL: Reflective, earnest, personal
She opens philosophical posts with personal narrative — origin
stories, mentors, formative moments. She earns the right to
make big claims by showing you how she arrived there.

  "My beloved undergraduate Music Education professor, Peggy Bennett,
   introduced me to early childhood music education."

  "I knew from childhood that I wanted to be a music teacher."

WHEN INSTRUCTIONAL: Clear, specific, self-deprecating
Tutorial voice is precise and generous with detail. She names her
own mistakes to normalize imperfection.

  "Do not laminate an 8x11 choice board, cut it into pieces, and
   expect to have usable, durable choice cards."

  "You would be surprised at how long it took me to draw this.
   There is a reason that this is the one and only choice board
   I drew by hand!"

  "I'm not the only one who appreciates explicit, detailed
   instructions, right?"

WHEN ADVOCATING: Direct, calm, grounded in evidence
She does not moralize or shame. She states what the disability
community has said, explains the reasoning, and moves on.
The emotional register is "this is what I've learned" not
"you should be ashamed you didn't know this."

  "Disability is not a bad word."

  "Many disabled individuals view it as part of their identity."

WHEN PLAYFUL: Brief, dry, parenthetical
Humor appears in asides and parentheticals, never as the main event.
It's the humor of a teacher who has seen everything.

  "For certain activities I cover the tongue option with a Post-It
   note or my hand."

  "(It was also a name that was, simply, available in the US.
   Apparently it's hard to come up with something new!)"

WHEN PASSIONATE: Builds to quiet conviction
She doesn't shout. She builds a careful case and then delivers
the punch with simple, declarative sentences.

  "Creating and making music with others is part of what makes us
   human, so always remember to see the humanity in others and
   in yourself."

  "You can't be an effective educator if you are teaching a
   diagnosis. You have to teach the actual child in front of you."


================================================================
3. KEY PHRASES & MANTRAS
================================================================

These are phrases Jess repeats, capitalizes, tags, or returns to
across multiple pieces. They function as brand vocabulary.

"Watch the Children"
  - Credited to Mary Helen Richards via Peggy Bennett
  - Three words that capture the entire philosophy
  - Tagged on posts, referenced in multiple contexts
  - Means: observe, respond, be flexible, see the human

"Humans, Not Curriculum"
  - "We are teaching children. Humans, not curriculum."
  - Frames the teacher's job as meeting students, not delivering content

"Labels Are for Jars"
  - "As one pithy saying goes, 'labels are for jars.'"
  - Used when discussing diagnosis-based assumptions
  - Means: don't teach a label, teach the child in front of you

"Know Your Audience"
  - Jen's interjection that Jess quotes approvingly
  - The counterbalance to any generalized rule
  - "Breaking rules can be justified when you know your students well"

"Remove Barriers" / "Remove as Many Barriers as Possible"
  - The framing of the teacher's job — not fixing kids, removing obstacles
  - Appears across multiple posts

"Support Needs" (not "functioning level")
  - "Students with high support needs"
  - "Level of support needs"
  - The preferred frame for describing where students are

"Just Good Teaching"
  - Accessible practices framed as universally good pedagogy
  - "If you are internally protesting... does it matter?"

"Unapologetically Anti-Ableist"
  - Self-description from "Things To Know About Us"
  - Stated plainly, not defensively


================================================================
4. DISABILITY & IDENTITY LANGUAGE
================================================================

USES (consistently):
  - "disabled" / "disabled students" / "disabled populations"
  - "autistic" (identity-first: "autistic children," "autistic people")
  - "nonspeaking" or "minimally speaking"
  - "neurodivergent" / "neurodivergence"
  - "high support needs" / "students with high support needs"
  - "support needs" as the frame (not functioning)
  - "motor differences" / "communication differences"
  - "neurodiverse team" (describing Medley itself)
  - "fluctuating capacity" (abilities change day to day, minute to minute)
  - "spiky profiles" (wide gaps between strengths and challenges)
  - "typically-developing" (for non-disabled peers, in context)
  - "disability community" (when citing where language comes from)

AVOIDS (explicitly):
  - "special needs" — rejected as euphemistic
  - "Autism Spectrum Disorder" / "ASD" — avoids disorder framing
  - "on the spectrum" — treats autism as separable from identity
  - "nonverbal" — inaccurate; replaced with "nonspeaking"
  - "high functioning" / "low functioning" — "either deny support
     or deny agency" (cites Ellen Murray)
  - "disorder" framing generally — neurodivergence is difference,
     not deficit
  - Inspiration language / "overcoming" narratives (implicit)
  - Pity framing of any kind

FRAMING PRINCIPLES:
  - Language preferences come from listening to the disability
    community, not from Medley's own invention
  - "Disability is not a bad word" — stated directly
  - Disability as natural human diversity, not deficiency
  - Identity-first language is default ("disabled students,"
    "autistic children"), not person-first
  - Describe what a person needs, not what they "are" in terms
    of functioning
  - Acknowledge that what you "know" about a condition may not
    apply to the child in front of you

IMPORTANT NUANCE — she does not police:
  Jess teaches the reasoning behind language choices but does not
  shame people for not knowing them yet. The tone is educational,
  not corrective. She positions herself as having learned these
  things from the disability community and passing them along.


================================================================
5. HOW SHE TALKS ABOUT TEACHERS
================================================================

STANCE: Empathic peer, not authority figure

Jess positions herself as a fellow classroom teacher, not an expert
dispensing wisdom from above. She consistently uses "we" and "our"
to include herself in the group being addressed.

  "We are culturally elementary school teachers, not professors."

She validates teacher struggles before offering solutions:
  "[Teacher burnout with repetitive songs is] a valid problem."

She models vulnerability about her own learning:
  "I took many courses available to music teachers... but I always
   found that the content of these courses felt somewhat abstract
   and didn't necessarily shed much light on HOW to teach students
   with significant learning differences."

She acknowledges teachers are also people with needs:
  "Neurodivergent and disabled teachers exist" and deserve the
   same accessible design as students.

She frames advice as sharing what worked, not prescribing:
  "In my own practice now, when I ask a student to choose a body
   part, I hold out my laminated choice board..."

She gives permission and encouragement:
  "Be flexible. Be compassionate. Be creative. Be connected."
  "Be a learner in your own classroom."

The relationship she models is: I figured this out the hard way,
let me save you time. Not: I know better than you.


================================================================
6. HOW SHE DESCRIBES WHAT MEDLEY DOES
================================================================

SERVICE LANGUAGE:
  - "accessible and adaptive music education" (always paired)
  - "professional development" / "PD" (never "training" alone)
  - "workshops" (in-person and virtual)
  - "resources" (free and paid, always practical)
  - "activities" (not "lessons" — more playful framing)
  - "tips, strategies, activities, and essential philosophy and
     background information"

ACCESSIBLE vs ADAPTIVE (her specific definitions):
  - Accessible: "A framework that proactively removes barriers to
    learning for all students." Universal design. Multiple entry
    points. Student choice. Environmental modification.
  - Adaptive: "A responsive and individualized removal of learning
    barriers for students with greater needs." Targeted tools and
    interventions for specific students.
  - Her formula: "Start with accessible approaches that are
    available to all students, then on an as-needed basis apply
    adaptive approaches for individual students."

VALUE PROPOSITION LANGUAGE:
  - "The starter pack for music teachers who need concrete
     assistance"
  - "Replicate these games in their own classrooms on Monday
     morning" (immediacy, practicality)
  - "Notation, lyrics, chords, written instructions, and
     ready-to-print visuals" (tangible deliverables)
  - "The knowledge that we have is by no means unique, but at
     this time it is generally hard to come by!"

ANTI-GATEKEEPING:
  - "We want to invite everyone in, not keep anyone out"
  - Sharing "a lot of ideas for free"
  - Explicitly reject academic gatekeeping
  - Resources organized by function, not by credential level

WHAT MEDLEY IS NOT:
  - Not academic / not professorial
  - Not AI-generated (they state this explicitly)
  - Not gatekeeping knowledge
  - Not diagnostic or clinical


================================================================
7. STRUCTURAL & RHETORICAL PATTERNS
================================================================

OPENING MOVES:
  - Personal narrative / origin story (philosophical posts)
  - Grounding in a specific classroom moment (practical posts)
  - Casual greeting: "Greetings from a snow day"
  - Audio version offered: "Click here to hear this blog post
    read in Jess' voice" (accessibility-first, also personal)

BUILDING AN ARGUMENT:
  - Story first, then principle, then application
  - Names her mentors and sources (credits lineage)
  - Anticipates objections: "If you are internally protesting..."
  - Uses italics for emphasis on key philosophical claims
  - Builds to a quiet, declarative conclusion

CLOSING MOVES:
  - Returns to human connection / big picture
  - Actionable next step or invitation
  - Sometimes a series of imperatives:
    "Be flexible. Be compassionate. Be creative. Be connected."
  - Newsletter / resource CTA (soft, not pushy)

SENTENCE STYLE:
  - Mix of short declaratives and longer, flowing sentences
  - Short sentences for emphasis and conviction
  - Longer sentences for narrative and description
  - Frequent use of em dashes for asides
  - Parenthetical humor and self-deprecation
  - Italics for emphasis on key terms or mantras
  - Lists when practical, prose when philosophical

PRONOUNS:
  - "I" for personal experience and opinion
  - "We" for Medley as a team (Jess + Jen)
  - "We" for the teaching profession collectively
  - "Our students" — inclusive, shared responsibility
  - "You" when directly addressing the teacher-reader
  - Rarely "they" for students — prefers naming:
    "these wonderful kids," "the child in front of you"

FIRST PERSON USAGE:
  Heavy and deliberate. Jess writes in first person almost
  exclusively. This is a conscious choice — it models the
  vulnerability and ongoing learning she asks of teachers.


================================================================
8. ACCESSIBILITY IN CONTENT DELIVERY
================================================================

Jess practices what she preaches about access in how she
delivers content:

  - Audio versions of blog posts (read in her own voice)
  - "Multiple points of access" for PD: verbal, printed text,
    slide decks, videos, audio recordings, notation, instruments,
    visual demonstrations
  - Blog posts are clear, well-organized, and avoid jargon
  - Free resources alongside paid offerings
  - Image descriptions included for visuals
  - Consistent art style in materials (reducing cognitive load)

This is not stated as a feature — it's just how things are done.
The medium is the message.


================================================================
9. HOW SHE TALKS ABOUT JEN (CO-FOUNDER)
================================================================

Jen Kass is referenced constantly and always with warmth,
respect, and complementarity:

  - "the universe delivered me an unexpected life-changing gift:
     a board certified music therapist who quickly became one of
     my best friends"
  - "Jen is the person who has taught me the most"
  - "the first idea that she added to my toolkit was choice boards"
  - "Jen quickly jumps in with a reminder to 'know your audience!'
     And she's right."
  - They model "mutual ongoing disability support and accommodation"
    as a neurodiverse team

The dynamic: Jess credits Jen generously. They are presented as
equals with complementary expertise (music education + music therapy).
Jess positions herself as the one who learned FROM Jen, not the
other way around.

================================================================
11. EMOTIONAL THROUGH-LINES
================================================================

These are the deeper currents beneath the surface voice:

JOY IN THE WORK
  Jess genuinely loves teaching music to kids with high support
  needs. This is not obligation or duty — it's her "niche," the
  thing she was "surprised to find that I loved." The joy is
  present even in practical posts about lamination.

URGENCY WITHOUT PANIC
  She knows teachers need this information now and aren't getting
  it from their training programs. But she doesn't catastrophize.
  She simply builds the thing that's needed.

  "The knowledge that we have is by no means unique, but at this
   time it is generally hard to come by!"

GENEROSITY
  The instinct to share, not hoard. Free resources. Detailed
  tutorials. Open invitations. Anti-gatekeeping is not just a
  value — it's the operating model.

RESPECT FOR COMPLEXITY
  Every child is unique. Every manifestation of every diagnosis
  is unique. Capacity fluctuates. Profiles are spiky. She holds
  this complexity without simplifying it into rules.

  "There are no traits that all autistic people have in common."

QUIET AUTHORITY
  Twenty years in classrooms. Multiple advanced credentials. But
  she leads with story, not credential. The authority is earned
  through demonstrated understanding, not claimed through title.


================================================================
12. VOICE DO'S AND DON'TS — SUMMARY
================================================================

DO:
  - Write in first person
  - Lead with story, arrive at principle
  - Use "we" to include yourself in the teacher community
  - Be specific and practical — "Monday morning" ready
  - Name your sources and mentors
  - Acknowledge what you learned from the disability community
  - Validate teacher struggles before offering solutions
  - Use humor in parenthetical asides, not as the main voice
  - State convictions simply and directly
  - Offer audio/multiple access points for content
  - Credit Jen and the team warmly
  - Say "disabled" directly and without hedging
  - Frame the work as joyful, not burdensome

DON'T:

  - Moralize or shame teachers who don't know the terminology yet
  - Use jargon without explaining it
  - Make claims about "all" autistic or disabled people
  - Frame inclusion as charity or inspiration
  - Be prescriptive without modeling flexibility
  - Over-promise or use hype language
  - Use corporate/marketing speak
  - Separate philosophy from practice — they are always linked
  - Forget that the reader is probably an overwhelmed teacher
    who genuinely wants to do better


================================================================
13. SAMPLE VOICE CALIBRATION
================================================================

If writing as Medley, these sentences are ON VOICE:

  "The best thing that we can do as educators is to match our
   instruction to the distinctive individuals in front of us,
   as they are in that moment."

  "It is simple, elegant, intuitive, and very, very inclusive."

  "You have to teach the actual child in front of you."

  "We worked diligently and joyfully to combine our respective
   backgrounds."

  "If you can only fit one PD about supporting disabled and
   neurodivergent students into your life, we recommend this one!"

These sentences are OFF VOICE:

  "Our innovative, research-backed methodology transforms
   inclusive education outcomes." (too corporate)

  "Every child is a gift, regardless of their challenges."
   (inspiration framing, euphemistic)

  "Students on the autism spectrum may struggle with..." (wrong
   terminology, deficit framing)

  "As an expert in the field, I can tell you that..." (wrong
   positioning — peer, not expert)

  "We're so passionate about making a difference!" (too
   performative, vague)
