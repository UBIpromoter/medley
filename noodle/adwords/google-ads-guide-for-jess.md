# Getting Started with Google Ads for Medley

Hey! Philip shared your message about nobody bidding on "adaptive music education" or "special needs music" — that's a really sharp catch. He and I dug into the pricing, keyword strategy, and setup steps together. Here's what we came up with.

## The Opportunity

You're right that no one is running ads on your key search terms. You can be the only sponsored result for very little money — and stop anytime.

## Pricing

- **You only pay when someone clicks**
- Music education keywords typically run **$2.50–$3.75/click**
- Uncontested niche terms (yours) can be much lower: **$0.50–$1.50/click**
- Education industry average is higher ($5–6/click) but that's driven by big competitive categories
- Start at **$5–10/day** (~$150–300/month), adjust from there

## Two Campaigns

### Campaign A: PD for Music Educators (nationwide)
**Landing page:** music-access.com/professional-development

**Keywords you're already thinking of:**
- adaptive music education
- special needs music

**Keywords to add — teachers search these too:**
- inclusive music education training
- special needs music teacher training
- teaching music to disabled students
- adaptive music PD
- neurodivergent music education
- music education professional development disability
- music education IEP accommodations
- adaptive music education course online
- inclusive music workshop

### Campaign B: Local Instruction (Western MA only)
**Landing page:** music-access.com/adaptive-music-instruction

**Keywords:**
- adaptive music lessons for kids
- special needs music program
- music classes for disabled children
- adaptive music instruction near me

## Setup Steps

1. Create account at [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com) — choose **Expert Mode**, skip "Smart Campaigns"
2. Use the free **Keyword Planner** to see actual search volume and costs for your keywords
3. Use "phrase match" and [exact match] only — avoid broad match
4. Set Manual CPC, max $1–2/click
5. Add **negative keywords**: *free, DIY, degree, jobs, salary, hiring, YouTube, music therapy certification*
6. Check the **Search Terms** report weekly — shows what people actually typed, worth the spend on its own
